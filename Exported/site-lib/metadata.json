ASV(approved scanning vendor) : An organization approved by the PCI SSC to conduct external vulnerability scanning services Merchant : an entity that accepts payment cards bearing the logos of any of the members of PCI SSC(American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa) as payment for goods/services. PAN(primary account number) : A payment card number that is up to 19 digits long.\nPayment Brand : Brands such as Visa, MasterCard, Amex, or Discover.\nPCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) : A person trained and certified to investigate and contain information about cybersecurity incidents and breaches involving cardholder data.\nQualified Security assessor (QSA) : An individual trained and certified to carry out PCI DSS compliance assessments. Service Provider : A business entity that is not a payment brand and that is directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data. This includes companies that provide services that control and could impact the security of cardholder data, such as managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, intrusion detection and other services, and hosting providers and other entities. Entities such as telecommunications companies that only provide communication links without access to the application layer of the communication link are excluded.\nThe PAN is the defining factor in the applicability of PCI DSS requirements. PCI DSS requirements apply if the PAN is stored, processed, or transmitted. if the PAN is not stored, processed, or transmitted, PCI DSS requirements no not apply. If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed, or transmitted with the PAN or are otherwise present in the cardholder data environment, they too must be protected. Per the standards, the PAN must be stored in an unreadable(encrypted) format. Sensitive authentication data may never be stored post-authorization, even if encrypted. The Luhn algorithm, or Luhn formula, is an industry algorithm used to validate different identification numbers, including credit card numbers, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, national provider identifier numbers in the United States, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, and more. The Luhn algorithm, created by Hans Peter Luhn in 1954, is now in the public domain.Most credit cards and many government organizations use the Luhn algorithm to validate numbers. The Luhn algorithm is based on the principle of modulo arithmetic and digital roots. It uses modulo-10 mathematics.The following are the typical elements on the front of a credit card:\nEmbedded microchip\nPAN\nExpiration date\nCardholder name\nThe microchip contains the same information as the magnetic stripe. Most non-U.S. cards have a microchip instead of a magnetic stripe. Some U.S. cards have both for international acceptance.The following are the typical elements on the back of a credit card:\nMagnetic stripe (mag stripe):&nbsp;The magnetic stripe contains encoded data required to authenticate, authorize, and process transactions.\nCAV2/CID/CVC2/CVV2:&nbsp;All these abbreviations are names for card security codes for the different payment brands.\n<br>The PCI SSC website provides great guidance on the requirements for penetration testing.

You should become familiar with any SLAs that the organization that hired you has provided to its customers. You must discuss and agree on the handling of confidential data. For example, if you are able to find passwords or other sensitive data, do you need to disclose all those passwords or all that sensitive data? who will have access to sensitive data? what will be the proper way to communicate and handle such data? Similarly, you must protect sensitive data and delete all records, per you agreement with your client. Your customer could have specific data retention policies that you might also have to be aware of. Every time you finish a penetration testing engagement, you should delete any records from your systems. You do not want your next customer to find sensitive information from another client in any system or communication. An SOW is a document that specifies the activities to be performed during a penetration testing engagement. It can be used to define some of the following elements: Project (penetration testing) timelines, including the report delivery schedule The scope of the work to be performed The location of the work (geographic location or network location)\nSpecial technical and nontechnical requirements\nPayment schedule\nMiscellaneous items that may not be part of the main negotiation but that need to be listed and tracked because they could pose problems during the overall engagement.\nThe SOW can be standalone document or can be part of a master service agreement (MSA) MSAs, which are very popular today, are contracts that can be used to quickly negotiate the work to be performed. When a master agreement is in place, the same terms do not have to be renegotiated every time you perform work for a customer. MSAs are especially beneficial when you perform a penetration test, and you know that you will be rehired on a recurring basis to perform additional tests in other areas of the company or to verify that the security posture of the organization has been improved as a result prior testing and remediation. An NDA is a legal document and contract between you and an organization that has hired you as penetration tester. An NDA specifies and defines confidential material, knowledge, and information that should not be disclosed and that should be kept confidential by both parties, NDAs can be classified as any of the following: Unilateral : Only one party discloses certain information to the other party. and the information must be kept protected and not disclosed. Bilateral : or mutual, or two-way, NDA both parties share sensitive information with each with each other, and this information should not be disclosed to any other entity. Multilateral : This type of NDA involves three or more parties, with at least one of the parties disclosing sensitive information that should not be disclosed to any entity outside the agreement. Multilateral NDAs are used in the event that an organization external to your customer (business partner, service provider, and so on) should also be engaged in the penetration testing engagement. statements such as \"the penetration test report cannot and does not protect against personal or business loss resulting from the test agreement\" agreement regarding how to communicate and handle sensitive data, such as account credentials that were uncovered by the testing","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

You need to document and agree upon these rule of engagement conditions with the client or an appropriate stakeholder. Gantt charts and work breakdown structures (WBS) can be used as tolls to demonstrate and document the timeline.<br>\nSample Elements of Rules of Engagement Document: <img alt=\"Pasted image 20250726233547.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250726233547.png\" target=\"_self\">Scoping is one of the most important elements of the pre-engagement tasks with any penetration testing engagement. You not only have to carefully identify and document all systems, applications, and networks that will be tested but also determine any specific requirements and qualifications needed to perform the test. The broader the scope of the penetration testing engagement, the more skills and requirements that will be needed. You may also be hired to perform an assessment of modern applications using different application programming interfaces (APIs), like : <br>SOAP : simple Object Access Protocol is an API standard that relies on XML and related schemas. XML-based specifications are governed by XML schema definition (XSD) documents. Having good reference of what a specific API supports can be very beneficial for a penetration tester and will accelerate the testing. The SOAP specification can be accessed at <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/soap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/soap\" target=\"_self\"><em></em></a>https://www.w3.org/TR/soap.\n<br>Swagger : (OpenAPI) documentation is a modern framework of API documentation and development that is now the basis of the OpenAPI Specification(OAS).

You must also agree and understand if you will be allowed to demonstrate how an external attacker could compromise your systems or how an insider could compromise internal assets. This external vs. internal target identification and scope should be clearly documented. It is a project management term that refers to the uncontrolled growth of a project's scope. It is also often referred to as kitchen sink syndrome, requirement creep, and function creep. Scope creep can put you out of business,. Many security firms suffer from scope creep and are unsuccessful because they have no idea how to identify when the problem starts or how to react to it.\nSituations in which you might encounter scope creep :\nWhen there is poor change management in the penetration testing engagement. when there is ineffective identification or what technical and nontechnical elements will be required for the penetration test When there is poor communication among stakeholders, including your client and your own team. The first step in validation the scope of an engagement is to question the client and review contracts. You must also understand who the target audience is for your penetration testing report. You should understand the subjects, business units, and any other entity that will be assessed by such a penetration testing engagement. Answering the following questions will help discover different characteristics of your target audience. What is the entity's or individual's need for the report ?\nWhat is the position of the individual who will be the primary recipient of the report within the organization?\nWhat is the main purpose and goal of the penetration testing engagement and ultimately the purpose of the report?\nWhat is the individual's or business unit's responsibility and authority to make decisions based on your findings?\nWho will the report be addressed to0 for example, the information security manager(ISM), chief information security officer (CISO), chief information officer (CIO), chief technical officer (CTO), technical teams, and so on?\nWho will have access to the report, which may contain sensitive information that should be protected, and whether access will be provided on a need-to-know basis?\nYou should have proper documentation of answers to the following questions.\nWhat is the contact Information for all relevant stakeholders?\nHow will you communicate with the stakeholders?\nHow often do you need to interact with the stakeholders?\nWho are the individuals you can contact at any time if an emergency arises?\nYou should ask for a form of secure bulk data transfer or storage, such as Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). You should also exchange any pretty Good Privacy (PGP) keys or Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) keys for encrypted mail exchanges. questions about budget and return on investment (ROI) may arise from both the client side and the tester sides in penetration testing. Like : How do i explain the overall cost of penetration testing to my boss?\nWhy do we need penetration testing if we have all these security technical and nontechnical controls in place?\nHow do i build in penetration testing as success factor?\nCan i do it myself?\nHow do i calculate the ROI for the penetration testing engagement?\nAt the same time the tester needs to answer questions like these :\nHow do i account for all items of the penetration testing engagement to avoid going over budget?\nHow do i do pricing?\nHow can i clearly show ROI to my clients? Also known as Black box pen testing, In this type of testing, The tester is typically provided only a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may be provided only the domain names and IP addresses that are in scope for a particular target. The idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester start out with the perspective that an external attacker might have. Typically, an attacker would first determine a target and then begin to gather information about the target, using public information, and gaining more and more information to use in attacks.\nThe tester would not have prior knowledge of the target's organization and infrastructure. Another aspect of unknown-environment testing is that sometimes the network support personnel of the target may not be given information about exactly when the test is taking place. This allows for a defense exercise to take place, and it also eliminates the issue of a target preparing for the test and not giving a real-world view of the security posture.In this type of testing, White-box pen testing , the tester starts out with a significant amount of information about the organization and its infrastructure. The tester is normally provided things like network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, and a set of user credentials. If the scope includes an applications assessment, the tester might also be provided the source code of the target application. The idea of this type of testing is to identify as many security holes as possible.

The path follows a fixed sequence of intermediate links.\nA logical channel gets defined on each physical link. In circuit switching, Three steps are required for communication, Connection establishment : Required before data transmission\nData transfer : Can proceed at maximum speed.\nConnection termination : Required after data transmission is over, For deallocation of network resources. Channel capacity is dedicated during the entire duration of communication. Acceptable for voice communication\nVery inefficient for bursty traffic like data. There is an initial delay for connection establishment. Modern form of long-distance communication Network resources are not dedicated. A link can be shared. The basic technology has evolved over time Basic concepts has remained the same. Data are transmitted in short packets (~Kbytes). A Longer message is broken up into smaller Chunks. The chunks are called Packets. Every packet contains a Header. Relevant information for routing, etc. Packet switching is based on store-and-forward concept. Each intermediate network node receives a whole packet. Decides the route. Forwards the packet along the selected route. Each intermediate note (router) maintains a routing table. Links can be shared; so link utilization is better. Suitable for computer-generated (bursty) traffic. Buffering and data rate conversion can be performed easily.\nSome packets may be given priority over others, if desired. Two alternative approaches: a) Virtual Circuits\nb) Datagram Similar in concept to circuit switching. A route is established before packet transmission starts. All packets follow the same path. The links comprising the path are not dedicated. Different from circuit switching in this respect. Telephone systems. Route is established a prior. Packet forwarded from one node to the next using store-and-forward scheme.\nonly the virtual circuit number need to be carried by a packet. Each intermediate node maintains a table.\nCreated during route establishment.\nUsed for packet forwarding. No dynamic routing decision is taken by the intermediate nodes. No route is established beforehand. Each packet is transmitted as an independent entity.\nDoes not maintain any history. Postal System.\nEvery Intermediate node has to take routing decisions dynamically. Makes use of a routing table.\nEvery packet must contain Source and Destination addresses. Packets may be delivered out of order\nIf a node crashes momentarily, all of its queued packets are lost. Duplicate Packets may also be generated. Faster than virtual circuit for smaller numbers of packets. No route establishment and termination. More flexible. Packets between two hosts may follow different paths. can handle congestion/failed link Three types of delays must be considered : Propagation Delay : Time taken by a data signal to propagate from one node to the next. Transmission Time : Time taken to send out a packet by the transmitter. Processing Delay : Time taken by a node to process a packet.

Reusability : Code can be reused using inheritance - no need to rewrite common functionalities. Encapsulation : Data and functions are bundled together, reducing complexity and increasing security.\nAbstraction : Hides internal implementation and shows only essential features. Inheritance : Promotes code reuse by allowing class to inherit properties and methods from another. Polymorphism : Allows The same function to behave differently based on the object(method overloading/overriding).

Powerful performance like C.\nSupports large, modular programs using OOP. Reusability: Use existing code. Scalability: Easy to extend. Security: Data hiding. Modularity: Programs are divided into objects. ✅ Exam Tip: \"OOP increases reusability, scalability, security, and modularity.\"\nFocuses on objects rather than procedures. Objects are real-world entities (Car, Student, etc.) with data + methods. OOP Concepts: Class: Blueprint of objects. Object: Instance of a class. Inheritance: Child class inherits from parent class. Polymorphism: Same name, different behavior. Encapsulation: Binding data + methods. Abstraction: Hiding internal details. It refers to bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operates on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\nKey Aspects of Encapsulation :\nData Hiding - Making fields (variables) private and providing access via public methods (getters and setters) . Controlled Access : prevents external code from directly modifying internal data, ensuring validation and security.\nModularity : Keeps related data and behavior together, improving code Organisation and reusability.\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\nusing namespace std; class BankAccount {\nprivate: // Hidden access string owner; double balance;\npublic: //controlled access BankAccount(string owner, double balance): owner(owner),balance(balance) {} void deposit(double amount){ if (amount &gt; 0) balance += amount;\n} void withdraw(double amount){ if (amoutn &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; amount &lt;= balance) balance -= amount;\n} double getBalance(){return balance;} string getOwner(){return owner;}\n}; int main(){ BankAccount acc(\"Alice\", 1000); acc.deposit(500); acc.withdraw(200); cout &lt;&lt; \"Balance: $\" &lt;&lt; acc.getBalance() &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;\n}\nIt is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a new class (derived/child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and fields) from an existing class (base/parent class).Key Points: Reusability : Avoid rewriting the same code by inheriting from a base class.\nExtensibility : Child classes can add new features or modify inherited ones.\nHierarchical Relationship : Represents an \"is-a\" relationship (eg, Car is a vehicle)\nExample of Single Inheritance#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; // Base class (Parent)\nclass Vehicle {\npublic: string brand = \"Toyota\"; void honk() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Beep! Beep!\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n}; // Derived class (Child)\nclass Car : public Vehicle { // 'public' inheritance\npublic: string model = \"Corolla\";\n}; int main() { Car myCar; cout &lt;&lt; \"Brand: \" &lt;&lt; myCar.brand &lt;&lt; endl; // Inherited from Vehicle cout &lt;&lt; \"Model: \" &lt;&lt; myCar.model &lt;&lt; endl; // Own property myCar.honk(); // Inherited method return 0;\n}\nExample of multiple inheritance#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; //base class 1\nclass Engine {\npublic : void start() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Engine started!\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n};\n//base class 2\nclass MusicSystem {\npublic: void play() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Music playing\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n}; //Derived class (inherits from both)\nclass Car : public Engine, public MusicSystem {}; int main() { Car mycar; mycar.start(); // From Engine mycar.play(); // from MusicSystem return 0;\n}\nMultilevel Inheritance#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; //base class\nclass Animal {\npublic: void eat() {cout &lt;&lt; \"Eating...\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n};\n//derived class\nclass Mammal : public Animal {\npublic: void breate(){ cout &lt;&lt; \"Breathing...\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n}; // Derived from Mammal\nclass Dog : public Mammal {\npublic: void bark() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Barking...\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n};\nHierarchical Inheritance#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; //Base class\nclass Vehicle {\npublic: void start() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Vehicle started!\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n}; //Derived class 1\nclass Car : public Vehicle {\npublic: void drive() { cout &lt;&lt; \"car is moving.\" &lt;&lt; endl;}\n}; //Derived class 2\nclass Bike : public Vehicle {\npublic: void ride() { cout &lt;&lt; \"bike is running.\" &lt;&lt; endl;} };\nHybrid Inheritance#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; //base class\nclass Person {\npublic: string name; Person(string n) : name(n){} void display() {cout &lt;&lt; \"Name: \" &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl;}\n}; //Derived 1\nclass Student : public Person {\npublic: int rollNo; Student(string n, int r) : Person(n), rollNo(r) {}\n}; //Derived 2\nclass Employee : public Person {\npublic: int empId; Employee(string n, int id) : Person(n), empId(id) {}\n}; // Derived from both student and Employee\nclass TeachingAsistant : public Student, public Employee {\npublic: TeachingAssistant(string n, int r, int id) : Student(n,r), Employee(n, id) {}\n}; int main() {\nTeachingAssistant ta(\"Alice\", 101, 1001); //ta.diaplay(); ❌Error (ambiguous, which display() to call?) //Solution : Use scope resolution ta.Student::display(); //calls Person's display() via Student cout &lt;&lt; \"Roll NO: \" &lt;&lt; ta.rollNo &lt;&lt; endl; coutn &lt;&lt; \"Employee ID: \" &lt;&lt; ta.empId &lt;&lt; endl;\nreturn 0;\n}\nInk drawing file not found.Polymorphism means \"Many forms\" , It allows object of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class.

Returns a&nbsp;pointer&nbsp;to that object (Animal*).\nit focuses on hiding complex implementation details while exposing only the essential features to users.\n\"Show what an object does, not how it does it.\" Abstract Class\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std; //Abstract class (cannot be instantiated)\nclass Shape {\npublic: //pure virtual function (makes shape abstract) virtual float area() = 0; void printArea() { cout &lt;&lt; \"Area: \" &lt;&lt; area() &lt;&lt; endl; // Uses abstract method }\n}; //Concrete class (implements the abstraction)\nclass Circle : public Shape { float radius;\npublic: Circle(float r) : radius(r) {} //Must implement area() (otherwise circle becomes abstract too) float area() override { return 3.14 * radius * radius; }\n};\nint main() { //shape s; // ❌ Error - can't instantiate abstract class Circle c(5); c.printArea(); // Output: Area: 78.5 return 0;\n} Interface (Pure Abstract Class)\nclass Drawable {\npublic: virtual void draw() =0; //pure virtual function virtual ~Drawable() {} //virtual destructor\n}; class Circle : public Drawable {\npublic: void draw() override { cout &lt;&lt; \"Drawing a circle\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n}; int main(){ Drawable* d = new circle(); d-&gt;draw(); delete d; return 0;\n} Simplifies Complex Systems Users interact with high-level interfaces without worrying about internal details. Reduces Complexity Changes to implementation don't affect code using the abstraction. Enforces Structure Derived classes must implement all abstract methods.
