TCP/IP is the most fundamental protocol used in the internet. 
- Allows computers to communicate / share resources. 
- Used as a standard. 
- To bridge the gap between non-compatible platforms. 

Work on TCP/IP started in 1970s, funded by US Military.
Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). 
- In 1978, International Standards Organization (ISO) proposed the 7-layer OSI refernce model for network services and protocols. 
- TCP/IP does not strictly follow the OSI model. 
- It follows a simplified 4-layer model.

- TCP/IP refers to a family of protocols. 
- The protocols are built on top of connectionless technology (datagrams). 
	- Data sent from one node to another as sequence of datagrams. 
	- Each datagram is sent independently. 
	- The datagrams corresponding to the same message may follow different routes. 
		- variable delay, arrival order at destination.
