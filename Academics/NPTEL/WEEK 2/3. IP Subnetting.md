## IP subnet 
- A subnet is a subset of a class A, B or C network.
- IP addresses without subnets consists of a network portion, and a host portion. 
	- Represents a static two-level hierarchical addressing model.
- IP subnets introduces a third level of hierarchy. 
- IP subnets introduces a third level of hierarchy.
	- a network portion
	- a subnet portion
	- a host portion
- Allow more efficient ( and structured ) utilization of the addresses. 
- Uses network masks. 
## Natural Masks
- Network mask 255.0.0.0 is applied to a class A network 10.0.0.0 .
	-  In binary, the mask is a series of contiguous 1's followed by a series of contiguous 0's.

- Provide a mechanism to split the ip address 10.0.0.20 into 
	- a network portion of 10, and 
	- a host portion of 20

|             | Decimal   | Binary                                          |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| IP address: | 10.0.0.20 | 00001010 00000000 00000000 00010100             |
| Mask:       | 255.0.0.0 | 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000             |
|             |           | Network  Host           Host              Host  |
- Class A, B and C addresses 
	- Have fixed division of network and host portions.
	- Can be expressed as masks.
		- Called natural masks.
- Natural Masks
	- Class A :: 255.0.0.0
	- Class B :: 255.255.0.0
	- Class C :: 255.255.255.0

## Creating Subnets using Masks
- Masks are very flexible. 
	- Using masks, networks can be divided into smaller subnets. 
	- By extending the network portion of the address into the host portion.
- Advantage:
	- We can create a large number of subnets from one network.
	- Can have less number of hosts per network.
## Example : Subnets 
- Network mask 255.255.0.0 is applied to a clas A network 10.0.0.0 . 
	- This divides the IP address 10.5.0.20 into 
		- a network portion of 10,
		- a subnet portion of 5, and 
		- a host portion of 20.
- The 255.255.0.0 mask borrows a portion of the host space, and applies it to network space. 

#### What happens ?
- Initially it was a single large Class A network ( 2$^{24}$ - 2) hosts. 
- We have now split the network into 256 subnets. 
	- From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.0.0. 
	- The hosts pet subnet decreases to 65,534.

### Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM) 
- The same network can be configured with different masks. 
- Can have subnets of different sizes. 
- Allows better utilization of available addresses. 

##### Example : VLSM
Suppose we are assigned a Class C network 192.203.17.0 . 
- To be divided into three subnets. 
	- Corresponding to three departments with 110,45 and hosts respectively. 
- Available subnet options 
	- The network mask will be the Class C natural mask 255.255.255.0
	- Subnet masks of the form 255.255.255.X 
		- Can be used to divide the network into more subnets. 


- Basic Concept : 
	- Use the mask 255.255.255.128 to divide the network address into two subnets with 128 hosts each.
		- 192.203.17.0 (.0 to .127)
		- 192.203.17.0 (.128 to .255)
	- Next subnet the second .128 subnet using a mask of 255.255.255.192. (creates two subnets, 64 hosts each)
		- 192.213.17.128 (.128 to .191 )
		- 192.213.17.128 (.192 to .255 )

## Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) 
- CIDR is a new concept to manage IP networks. 
	- Classless Inter Domain Routing. 
	- No concept of class A, B, C networks. 
	- Reduces sizes of routing tables. 
- An IP address is represented by a prefix, which is the IP address of the network. 
- It is followed by a slash, followed by a number M.
	- M : number of leftmost contiguous bits to be used for the network mask.
	- Example : 144.16.192.57 / 18
## CIDR : An Important Rule 
- The number of addresses in each block must be a power of 2. 
- The beginning address in each block must be divisible by the number of addresses in the block. 
	- A block that contains 16 addresses cannot have beginning address as 144.16.223.36. 
	- But the address 144.16.192.64 is possible.
