## Rules of Engagement : 
The rules of engagement document specifies the conditions under which the security penetration testing engagement will be conducted. You need to document and agree upon these rule of engagement conditions with the client or an appropriate stakeholder. 

Gantt charts and work breakdown structures (WBS) can be used as tolls to demonstrate and document the timeline.
Sample Elements of Rules of Engagement Document: ![[Pasted image 20250726233547.png]]

## Target List and In-Scope Assets
Scoping is one of the most important elements of the pre-engagement tasks with any penetration testing engagement. You not only have to carefully identify and document all systems, applications, and networks that will be tested but also determine any specific requirements and qualifications needed to perform the test. The broader the scope of the penetration testing engagement, the more skills and requirements that will be needed. 

You may also be hired to perform an assessment of modern applications using different application programming interfaces (APIs), like : 

- **SOAP :** simple Object Access Protocol is an API standard that relies on XML and related schemas. XML-based specifications are governed by XML schema definition (XSD) documents. Having good reference of what a specific API supports can be very beneficial for a penetration tester and will accelerate the testing. The SOAP specification can be accessed at [_https://www.w3.org/TR/soap_](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap).
- **Swagger :** (OpenAPI) documentation is a modern framework of API documentation and development that is now the basis of the OpenAPI Specification(OAS). These documents are used in representational state transfer (REST) APIs. REST is a software architectural style designed to guide development of the architecture for web services (including APIs). REST, or "RESTful," APIs are the most common types of APIs used today. Swagger documents can be extremely beneficial when testing APIs. Additional information about Swagger can be obtained at https://swagger.io. The OAS is available at https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification. 
- **WSDL :** Web Services Description Language is an XML-based language that is used to document the functionality of a web service. The WSDL specification can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20-primer.
- **GraphQL :** is a query language for APIs, It is also a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. Additional technical information about GraphQL can be accessed at https://graphql.org/learn.
- **WADL :** Web Application Description Language is an XML-based language for describing web applications. The WADL specification can be obtained from [_https://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl_](https://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl).


It is very important to document the physical location where the penetration testing will be done, as well as the Domain Name System (DNS) fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of the applications and assets that are allowed (including any subdomains). You must also agree and understand if you will be allowed to demonstrate how an external attacker could compromise your systems or how an insider could compromise internal  assets. This external vs. internal target identification and scope should be clearly documented. 

### Scope Creep : 
It is a project management term that refers to the uncontrolled growth of a project's scope. It is also often referred to as kitchen sink syndrome, requirement creep, and function creep. Scope creep can put you out of business,. Many security firms suffer from scope creep and are unsuccessful because they have no idea how to identify when the problem starts or how to react to it. 
Situations in which you might encounter scope creep :
1. When there is poor change management in the penetration testing engagement. 
2. when there is ineffective identification or what technical and nontechnical elements will be required for the penetration test 
3. When there is poor communication among stakeholders, including your client and your own team. 

## Validating the Scope of Engagement : 
The first step in validation the scope of an engagement is to question the client and review contracts. You must also understand who the target audience is for your penetration testing report. You should understand the subjects, business units, and any other entity that will be assessed by such a penetration testing engagement. 

**Answering the following questions will help discover different characteristics of your target audience.** 
- What is the entity's or individual's need for the report ?
- What is the position of the individual who will be the primary recipient of the report within the organization?
- What is the main purpose and goal of the penetration testing engagement and ultimately the purpose of the report?
- What is the individual's or business unit's responsibility and authority to make decisions based on your findings?
- Who will the report be addressed to0 for example, the information security manager(ISM), chief information security officer (CISO), chief information officer (CIO), chief technical officer (CTO), technical teams, and so on?
- Who will have access to the report, which may contain sensitive information that should be protected, and whether access will be provided on a need-to-know basis?

**You should have proper documentation of answers to the following questions.**
- What is the contact Information for all relevant stakeholders?
- How will you communicate with the stakeholders?
- How often do you need to interact with the stakeholders?
- Who are the individuals you can contact at any time if an emergency arises?

You should ask for a form of secure bulk data transfer or storage, such as Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). You should also exchange any pretty Good Privacy (PGP) keys or Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) keys for encrypted mail exchanges. 

**questions about budget and return on investment (ROI) may arise from both the client side and the tester sides in penetration testing.  Like :** 
- How do i explain the overall cost of penetration testing to my boss?
- Why do we need penetration testing if we have all these security technical and nontechnical controls in place?
- How do i build in penetration testing as success factor?
- Can i do it myself?
- How do i calculate the ROI for the penetration testing engagement?

**At the same time the tester needs to answer questions like these :**
- How do i account for all items of the penetration testing engagement to avoid going over budget?
- How do i do pricing?
- How can i clearly show ROI to my clients?

## Strategy: Unknown vs. Known Environment Testing. 

### Unknown-Environment Testing : 
 Also known as **Black box pen testing**, In this type  of testing, The tester is typically provided only a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may be provided only the domain names and IP addresses that are in scope for a particular target. The idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester start out with the perspective that an external attacker might have. Typically, an attacker would first determine a target and then begin to gather information about the target, using public information, and gaining more and more information to use in attacks. 
 The tester would not have prior knowledge of the target's organization and infrastructure. Another aspect of unknown-environment testing is that sometimes the network support personnel of the target may not be given information about exactly when the test is taking place. This allows for a defense exercise to take place, and it also eliminates the issue of a target preparing for the test and not giving a real-world view of the security posture.

### Known-Environment Testing :
In this type of testing, **White-box pen testing** , the tester starts out with a significant amount of information about the organization and its infrastructure. The tester is normally provided things like network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, and a set of user credentials. If the scope includes an applications assessment, the tester might also be provided the source code of the target application. The idea of this type of testing is to identify as many security holes as possible.
